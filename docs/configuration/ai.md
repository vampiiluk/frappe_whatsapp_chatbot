2. Enable **Enable AI**
3. Select **AI Provider**: OpenAI or Anthropic
4. Enter your **AI API Key**
5. Configure model settings
6. Click **Save**

## Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **AI Provider** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Custom | - |
| **AI API Key** | Your API key | - |
| **AI Model** | Model to use | gpt-4o-mini |

| **Temperature** | Creativity (0-1) | 0.7 |
| **Include Conversation History** | Include recent messages for context | Off |
| **History Messages** | Number of recent messages to include | 4 |
| **System Prompt** | Instructions for the AI | Default assistant prompt |

### Recommended Models

**OpenAI:**
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Fast, cheap, good for most use cases
- `gpt-4o` - More capable, higher cost

**Anthropic:**
- `claude-3-haiku-20240307` - Fast, cheap
- `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` - Balanced
- `claude-3-opus-20240229` - Most capable

**Google:**
- `gemini-2.0-flash` - Fast, free tier available
- `gemini-2.5-flash` - Latest flash model
- `gemini-2.5-pro` - Most capable

## System Prompt

The system prompt tells the AI how to behave.

### Recommended System Prompt

Use this prompt to prevent the AI from claiming to perform actions it cannot do:

```
You are a helpful customer service assistant. Be concise, friendly, and professional.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- You can ONLY provide information from the context given to you
- You CANNOT perform any actions like sending emails, resetting passwords, creating orders, etc.
- If a user asks you to DO something (reset password, send email, place order), tell them you cannot perform actions and guide them to the appropriate channel
- Never claim to have done something you didn't do
- If you don't know something, say so honestly
```

### Basic Example

```
You are a helpful customer service assistant for ABC Company.
Be concise, friendly, and professional.
Our business hours are Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 6 PM.
If you don't know something, say so and offer to connect with a human agent.
Do not make up information about products or prices.
```

## AI Context

Provide knowledge to the AI through **WhatsApp AI Context** documents.

### Static Text Context

Add fixed information like company details, FAQ, policies.

1. Go to **WhatsApp AI Context** → **+ Add**
2. Set **Context Type**: Static Text
3. Enter your content in **Static Content**
4. Click **Save**

Example:
```
Title: Company Info
Context Type: Static Text
Static Content:
ABC Company was founded in 2010.
We specialize in software solutions.
Our main products are:
- Product A: $99/month
- Product B: $199/month
- Product C: $499/month
```

### DocType Query Context

Dynamically include data from your Frappe database.

1. Go to **WhatsApp AI Context** → **+ Add**
2. Set **Context Type**: DocType Query
3. Select the **DocType**
4. Specify **Fields to Include**
5. Add **Filters** if needed
6. Click **Save**

Example:
```
Title: Product Catalog
Context Type: DocType Query
DocType: Item
Fields to Include: item_name, description, standard_rate
Filters: {"disabled": 0, "is_sales_item": 1}
```

### Priority

Higher priority contexts are included first. Use this to ensure important information is always included.

### Trigger Keywords

Load context only when the user's message contains specific keywords. This reduces token usage and keeps responses focused.

1. Go to **WhatsApp AI Context** → Edit
2. Add keywords to **Trigger Keywords** field (comma-separated)
3. Context is only included when message contains any of these words

Example:
```
Title: Refund Policy
Context Type: Static Text
Trigger Keywords: refund, return, money back, cancel
Static Content:
Our refund policy:
- Full refund within 30 days of purchase
- Partial refund (50%) within 60 days
- No refunds after 60 days
- Contact support@example.com to request
```

This context only loads when user mentions "refund", "return", etc.

### User-Specific Context

For DocType queries, you can filter by the user's phone number:

1. Enable **User Specific** checkbox
2. Set **Phone Number Field** to the field containing phone numbers

Example:
```
Title: User Orders
Context Type: DocType Query
DocType: Sales Order
Fields to Include: name, status, grand_total, transaction_date
User Specific: Yes
Phone Number Field: contact_mobile
```

This includes only the current user's orders in the AI context.

## How It Works

1. User sends a message
2. Chatbot checks for active flow, keyword match, flow trigger
3. If nothing matches and AI is enabled:
   - Build context from AI Context documents
   - Include recent conversation history
   - Send to AI provider
   - Return AI response

## Limitations

- AI responses may occasionally be incorrect
- API costs apply based on your provider
- Response time depends on the AI provider
- No guarantee of consistent responses

## Token Optimization

To reduce API costs and avoid token limits:

1. **Disable conversation history** - Only enable if context is essential
2. **Use trigger keywords in AI Context** - Context with keywords only loads when relevant
3. **Limit history messages** - Keep to 4 or fewer messages
4. **Keep context concise** - DocType queries use compact JSON automatically

## Best Practices

1. **Keep system prompts focused** - Be specific about what the AI should and shouldn't do
2. **Use context wisely** - Include relevant information but don't overload
3. **Set appropriate temperature** - Lower (0.3) for factual, higher (0.7) for conversational
4. **Monitor usage** - Check your API costs regularly
5. **Have fallbacks** - Configure a default response in case AI fails
